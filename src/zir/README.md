# ZIR
This helper library is independent of the main compiler in hopes that it may be useful to other projects. It implements a simple TAC IR based on TACKY from Nora Sandler's [Writing a C Compiler](https://play.google.com/store/books/details/Nora_Sandler_Writing_a_C_Compiler?id=6StmEAAAQBAJ) book.
